I’ve had stuff on the web for a very long time - some of it dating back to the early-to-mid 1990s. Rather than continuing to spread stuff out over a half-dozen different silos, I’ve decided to reclaim ownership of my (questionably useful) content here. Most of the action will be on the blog, but it’s possible that other things will crop up here from time to time.

You are notified in advance that I blog chiefly to organize my thoughts around books that I’m reading. Semi-regular writing is a way of holding myself accountable to the material. This is my polite way of saying that the bulk of the material on this site has an intended audience of precisely one. Well, maybe two. In other words, there's going to be very little here that's work-related.

I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jquinby), for whatever that’s worth. If you're a ham, you can find out a bit more about my setup at [QRZ](https://www.qrz.com/db/KM4SYN). I also hang around [/r/amateurradio](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio) and in its non-official-yet-somehow affiliated IRC channel (#redditnet on Geekshed).
