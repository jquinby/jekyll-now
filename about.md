>_As to more than these, my son, beware. Of the making of many books there is no end, and in much study there is weariness for the flesh._  
--- Ecc 12:12

Exactly as described above. Scribblings.

You are notified in advance that I blog chiefly to organize my thoughts around books that I’m reading. Semi-regular writing is a way of holding myself accountable to the material. This is my polite way of saying that the bulk of the material on this site has an intended audience of precisely one. Well, maybe two. In other words, there's going to be very little here that's work-related.

Current reading activity is as follows.

In progress:  
_Male and Female He Made Them: A Theology of the Body_, Pope John Paul II  

On Deck:  
_Making Small Groups Work_, Henry Cloud  
_How to Lead Small Groups_, Neal McBride
