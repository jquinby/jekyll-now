Following is a list of the books I've either read or am currently
reading. The list has formed somewhat organically, which is to say
that some of these lead naturally from one to the next. Others appeared
by way of recommendations made by various public figures, still others
because they've shown up in the footnotes of some other book I was
reading. In addition to the books, I subscribe to _First Things_, _The
Atlantic_, a couple of ACM journals related to work, and - of course -
_QST_, like any good ham. If I'm flying or in the car for more than an
hour or two, I'm probably listening to podcasts, _First Things_,
_Reply All_, or _99% Invisible_.

Listening to Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks' [2013 Erasmus Lecture](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2014/01/on-creative-minorities) started the whole thing, if you want to know the truth. I blame him entirely for bringing Toynbee to my attention.

This list is updated as I finish things and add to the incoming queue.

_Vatican II: The Essential Texts_, ed. Norman Tanner, SJ
