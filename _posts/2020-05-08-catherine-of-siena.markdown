title:  Sarah, Conrad, and St. Catherine of Siena
---
It's been awhile since I posted any sort of update, so here we are. After
finishing Cardinal Sarah's _Silence_, I started _The Day is Now Far Spent_. I
got about 100 pages in and stopped. It's not really my bag, and I'm not sure how
much shelf-life it will have, as it seems (so far) very much a response to a
particular time and place. I can take a few guesses as to who the intended
audience of this book is, and I'm pretty sure it's not me.  

By way of a break from spiritual reading, I found myself re-reading _Nostromo_
by Joseph Conrad and obsessing, in a minor way, about its imaginary setting.
What would modern Sulaco be like? A second- or third-tier cruise ship
destination? Super exclusive, with a few casinos and high-end clubs? I dreamed
up vintage Pan Am posters advertising Clipper service to Costaguana and tried to
find maps of the country to see if they squared with my mental reckoning of the
place. Spoiler: I couldn't find any, and it is believed that Conrad didn't have
one either, owing to certain inconsistencies in his descriptions of place and
distance. This seems to be born out by some articles I found on JSTOR. Colombia
seems to be the likeliest inspiration.

I don't know why the invented country has grabbed me like it has.
Maybe it's _almost_ real in a way that, say, Middle Earth isn't. The
verisimilitude is dinged a little bit for me with some of Conrad's Spanish,
which feels clumsy and inauthentic, like someone who's writing
about a place he's only read about. But those Pan Am posters...I would 100% buy 
one if I could find it. I can see them in my head so clearly that maybe I'll find 
a way to create them myself.

Then April ended, and with it we celebrated the Feast of Saint Catherine of
Siena, mystic, Dominican tertiary, and Doctor of the Church. She holds a special
place for us; my wife was received (and I was re-received) at a parish named for
her (before winding up at a church named for yet another a Dominican tertiary).
Even so, I hadn't read any of her work and all the quotes showing up on Catholic
twitter inspired me to pick up _The Dialogue_, which I'm working through very
slowly. So far, so good.  

In other news: the formation program for the diaconate is on pause for a year
because of the pandemic. Public Mass may be starting up again soon, which is
wonderful. The weather has gone all haywire. After one late frost which killed
my vegetable seedlings and pummeled my fig, we're due for another one tonight,
which means I'll be out covering everything up (again) and hoping for the best. This
would be the latest freeze ever recorded here, breaking a 90-year old record.
