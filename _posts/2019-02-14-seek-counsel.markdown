title: Seeking counsel
---

>Do to no one what you yourself dislike. Give to the hungry some of your bread, 
and to the naked some of your clothing. Seek counsel from every wise man. At 
all times bless the Lord God, and ask him to make all your paths straight and 
to grant success to all your endeavors and plans.  
-- Tobit 4:15a, 16a, 18a, 19, Morning Prayer, Wed. of Week 1

So recently I took a deep dive into the OT and found myself consulting one
Jewish source after another in an attempt to better understand the text and its
meaning. One thing led to another and I ended up starting _Essays on Ethics: A
Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible_ by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. I've been a fan of
his for some time, ever since hearing a lecture he gave in New York several
years back on the subject of creative minorities. 

I'm about 2/3 of the way through the book, and I'm reading it straight
through. The chapters, though, are meant to be read as companion pieces to the
weekly readings of the Torah, or _parsha_.  Here's a bit from the various first
piece, on _Bereshit_, "In the beginning," Genesis 1:1-6:8:

>What exactly is being said in the first chapter of the Torah? The first thing
to note is that it is not a standalone utterance, an account without a context.
It is in fact a polemic, a protest, against a certain way of understanding the
universe. In all ancient myth the world was explained in terms of battles of the
gods in their struggle for dominance. The Torah dismisses this way of thinking
totally and utterly. God speaks and the universe comes into being. This,
according to the great nineteenth-century sociologist Max Weber, was the end of
myth and the birth of Western rationalism...The universe that God made and that
we inhabit is not about power or dominance but about _tov_ and _ra_, good and
evil. For the first time, religion was ethicised. God cares about justice,
compassion, faithfulness, loving-kindness, the dignity of the individual, and
the sanctity of life.

The _parsha_ are explored like this with a particular focus on the ethical
dimensions: what is going on here, what is revealed about God, and what do we do
now, and so on. There is wisdom here for anyone to read. Highly recommended.
