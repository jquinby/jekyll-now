title: A Grammar of Assent
---
I'm about halfway through Newman's _An Essay in Aid of a Grammer of Assent_, and
I am about ready to call it quits. It's...dense. I love Newman's writing, but this
is far enough beyond me that I'm quite OK laying it aside for the time being. I'll wrap up
his sermons (I think I'm the last one or two) and continue to use the little book of daily
meditations, which are gorgeous.

If you would like to wade deeply into Newman's _magnum opus_ on the philosophy of religious
believe, by all means: dive in. You can get it for free at Project Gutenberg. 

As for what's next: I've been wanting to get acquainted with Hannah Arendt's writing,
and found _The Portable Hannah Arendt_, which looks like it will fit the bill right nicely.
