From today's Office of Readings, words which struck me as
I caught up on the terrible news of this weekend.

>The Lord has given us these three basic doctrines: hope for 
eternal life, the beginning and end of our faith; justice, the 
beginning and end of righteousness; and love, which bears cheerful 
and joyous witness to the works of righteousness. Now the Lord 
has made the past and present known to us through his prophets, 
and he has given us the ability to taste the fruits of the future 
beforehand. Thus, when we see prophecies fulfilled in their 
appointed order, we ought to grow more fully and deeply in awe 
of him. Let me suggest a few things – not as a teacher, but as 
one of you – which should bring you joy in the present situation.  
When evil days are upon us and the worker of malice gains 
power, we must attend to our own souls and seek to know the 
ways of the Lord. In those times reverential fear and 
perseverance will sustain our faith, and we will find need of 
forbearance and self-restraint as well. Provided that we hold 
fast to these virtues and look to the Lord, then wisdom, understanding, 
knowledge and insight will make joyous company with them.

From the beginning of a letter attributed to Barnabas.
