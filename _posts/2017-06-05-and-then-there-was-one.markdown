title: And Then There Was One

Colony, that is. The questionable one petered out and that was that. Pulled the comb and put it in the freezer for awhile to kill off any wax worms. Should serve a split well later on this summer.

The other colony is doing well and has drawn out the second brood box. Still haven't started in on the super yet. Hopefully soon. The weather has been cool and damp and I'm sort of crossing my fingers for some extended clover time. The nectar dearth traditionally starts about now but maybe we'll get a little extension.

Radiowise: I ordered an LDG Z100+ antenna tuner and look forward to seeing if I can lick 60m and 20m on my end-fed setup.
