title:  The Wisdom of the Desert

> A certain philosopher asked St. Anthony: Father, how can you be so happy when
you are deprived of the consolation of books? Anthony replied: My book, O
philosopher, is the nature of created things, and any time I want to read the
words of God, the book is before me.

Another:

>Abbot Lot came to Abbot Joseph and said: Father, according as I am able, I keep
my little rule, and my little fast, my prayer, meditation and contemplative
silence; and according as I am able, I strive to cleanse my heart of thoughts:
now what more should I do? The elder rose up in reply and stretched out his
hands to heaven, and his fingers became like ten lamps of fire. He said: Why
not be totally changed into fire?
