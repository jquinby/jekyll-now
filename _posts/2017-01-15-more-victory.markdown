I significantly adjusted the 20m legs and re-tied them so that they're not quite on the same plane as the 40m, hoping to reduce any interaction. Success! The radio is showing under 1.5 across the band, even before letting the ATU do it's thing. I seem to be good for 40, 20, and 15m. I'll probably add 10m for the sake of completeness and then lay off multiple trips to the attic while I'm ahead. Now it's time to nerve up and actually key the mic a few times. O_o
