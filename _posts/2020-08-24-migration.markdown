title:  Migrating to micro.blog...
---
I've decided to migrate to [micro.blog](https://jquinby.micro.blog). No specific fault with github or jekyll; I've just decided to start curtailing my use of free services as much as I can.
Remember: if you're not paying for it, you're not the customer. You're the product. I've switched to a paid e-mail provider, and will probably find a new way to share my
bug and plant pictures with the world. For Twitter, I'll probably go read-only on a careful list of people/places/things that I'm most interested in. Local stuff, for the most
part, and some amateur radio ops I know from here and there.
