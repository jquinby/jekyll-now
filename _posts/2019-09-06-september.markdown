>When the thistle blooms and the chirping cicada  
sits on trees and ours down shrill song  
from frenziedly quivering wings in the toilsome summer  
then goats are fatter than ever and wine is at its best  
-- Hesiod


We're in that weird time of the year where the evenings are beautifully cool
and the days are still in the mid-90s. The insects and plants are not fooled.
Leaves are just starting to blush a little on some trees and the late summer
insects are on the move. Do you have phases of insects? We do. In spring, the
crane flies erupt from the grass in huge clouds and manage to find their way
into the house, grossing everyone out. Early summer is time for the Japanese
beetles. Midsummer, we get the June bugs: large buzzy emeralds that zoom around
just above the grass, driving the chickens crazy. About this time the cicadas
turn up - annuals every summer, periodic hordes on their own particular 
schedule. 

In late summer, we get the scolidae wasps: dark, blue-winged wasps that
zoom around over the grass looking for the larvae of the aforementioned 
Japanese beetles. The wasps are thereby my immediate friends. They're nice
looking, too: deep purple, almost black, with a cinnamon-tipped abdomen adorned
by two distinct yellow dots. They're non-aggressive and spend most of their 
time flying in large groups here and there over the grass, hunting the buried
grubs that will feed their young.

Late summer is also the time for praying mantises at their largest, stickbugs,
and butterflies all over the remaining zinnias and gomphrenas. The little 
butterfly bush near the porch has hosted monarch caterpillars in years past but
I haven't seen any this year. The pawpaw attracted tiger swallowtails to 
lay their eggs, but I pulled the larvae off to give the tree another season or
two of growth before they make off with all the leaves.

Before much longer, the real heralds of fall will arrive: garden spiders and
other large orb-weavers will appear in the remains of the tomato plants or 
in improbably big webs between trees. That's when I know the party's nearly over.
Until then, we still get the soft daytime hum of the field crickets and a cicada or 
two. The hummingbirds are still fighting over the feeders and hopefully getting
fat for their big flight south. And the sky has turned that cobalt blue once
or twice. The afternoon light is a little redder, and the shadows are coming a 
little sooner. 

Then the quietude. The insects will be gone until spring and I'll miss their
comings and goings, and especially their sounds. As for winter, I have plans for 
a 3-chambered bat house hanging above my desk. I hope to site it in the farthest
part of our back yard, where it's close enough to see but far enough away that
nothing ought to disturb any bats who happen to move in. I saw a bat house in 
an urban garden recently end it was certainly full of bats. I figure if they can be 
happy there, perhaps they can be happy here too.  

As far as books go, I just finished Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ and I'm re-perusing
Joseph Pieper's _The Four Cardinal Virtues_ while I try to figure out what to
read next. 

TV-wise, we're waiting for the return of _The Expanse_, _Better Call Saul_, 
_The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel_, _The Crown_. The trailer for HBO's _Watchmen_ caught 
my attention, too. Over a couple of nights this week, I watched the BBC/Amazon
production of _King Lear_ and I thought it was great. I'll never read it again
without seeing Anthony Hopkins, Jim Broadbent, and Emily Watson in my head.
