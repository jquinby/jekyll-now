I recently bought an "EARCHI end-fed antenna":http://www.earchi.org/proj_homebrew.html, put it together in about 30 minutes (20 of which were winding and re-winding the toroid) and have been testing it out, by which I mean, trying to get it to tune

* in the attic,
* using the included 30' wire with and without a counterpoise,
* with and without an RF choke
* outside the attic
* with a longer wire and a counterpoise

I switched out the 30' wire they included with a 53' length, and here's where things stand right now, using the internal ATU of the radio. The matchbox end is just inside a second story attic window, with a 16' counterpoise in the attic. The main antenna element slopes down to a nearby tree to about 6' above ground. It's not ideal, but it's the closest tree I have. Herewith the latest results:

| Band | SWR |
| ---- |-----|
|6m |1.1 |
|10m |1.0|
|12m |1.0|
|15m |1.0|
|17m |1.0|
|20m |>3 across board |
|30m |1.0 |
|40m |tunes under 3 down to 7.180. Below that, it spikes over 3.|
|60m |nope |
|80m |ok > 3.600. Below that, no|

So on the one hand, here are a whole pile of new bands! On the other hand, losing all of 20m and the bottom edge of 40m sucks because I just started working JT65, JT9 and PSK31 there. [The consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/5wd0dj/can_anyone_help_me_understand_some_endfed_antenna/) is that an external tuner will do the trick. Hard to fault the built-in one too badly, though. I will add an air choke back to the feedline at the matchbox, though, and see if it makes a difference. If nothing else it'll minimize RF coming into the shack. Now if only the weather would clear out so conditions would improve a bit...
