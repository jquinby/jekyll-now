title: Maus

We recently moved our oldest son into his university dorm, our first child to go
out of state and far away. Bittersweet, to be sure, though we had all been
quietly getting ready for it well in advance. The campus is small and intimate
and he'll be walking into a ready-made community by way of his teammates. I
spent some time nosing around the campus bookstore and came upon Art Spiegelman's
_Maus_, which has been on my to-read list for years. So I grabbed it - the
hardback definitive edition - and finished it in about 2 days. 

_Maus_ was every bit as good as I had expected. You'd think that a story as
amazing as this would be tempered slightly by the format - comic book? With mice
and cats? But no. If anything, it felt _more_ focused to me. The drawing style
is spare and there are panels that will be me for awhile. The story is amazing
enough. Highly recommended, even if graphic novels aren't usually your thing.
