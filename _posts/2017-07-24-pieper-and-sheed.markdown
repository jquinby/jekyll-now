title: Pieper and Sheed

I finished Josef Pieper's _The Four Cardinal Virtues_ and liked it very much. I foresee going back to it frequently for refresh and review. Also thoroughly enjoyed Frank Sheed's _Theology for Beginners_, so much so that I have another of his books, _Theology and Sanity_, ready to go for some upcoming travel. In the meanwhile, I've (slowly) begun working my way through the _Summa Contra Gentiles_. You can get it for the Kindle for a buck.

Looking ahead I can see a pivot into deeper scriptural study. I was perusing the reading lists at the Dominican House of Studies and a [book on the Wisdom literature](https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Literature-Interpreting-Biblical-Texts/dp/0687008468) by Richard Clifford caught my eye. Apropos, I started re-reading Job last night, making it as far as Elihu's appearance.

The HF rig is headed back to Yaesu. Something is wonky with the transmit circuit and it's still under warranty, so off it goes. Bummer, too - the new FT8 digital mode is taking off and and I had just dipped my toe in it before everything went ahoo. Such is life.
