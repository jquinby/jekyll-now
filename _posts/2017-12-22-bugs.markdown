title: Hiatus due to bugs
---

So we had a lovely still stomach bug sweep through the household in 3 waves. First it came for the littles, but they got over pretty quickly as the littles often do. Then it came for the basically everyone else, leaving only my oldest son and I standing. Then I got it. Now he has it, so it's been something of a clean sweep. Two blessings at work here. First, it goes nearly as quickly as it arrives, so you get 24 hours of misery and then recovery begins. The second blessing is that it'll clear out by Christmas, so we're not waiting around for the final shoe to drop on anyone else getting sick. Will be glad to get this completely behind us.

In the meanwhile...let's see. I logged the last couple of contacts I needed to qualify for Worked All States and have dutifully sent in my application and money. ARRL seems to have accepted everything so now I'm just waiting for it to show up in the mail. I may go hunting for some band endorsements, but the Triple Play has me eyeballing CW again so I've dusted off a few of the "Learn Morse Code" apps I was using awhile back and started playing with them again. According to LoTW, I've got 44 confirmed DXCC entities, so that'd be another one to start working on. 

Reading: _The Spirit of the Liturgy_ by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI. Also re-reading _Farenheit 451_ for the first time since high school. Also the usual stack of magazines.
