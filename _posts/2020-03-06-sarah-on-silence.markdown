title: Cardinal Sarah on Silence
---

Am about halfway through Robert Cardinal Sarah's _The Power of Silence: Against the
Dictatorship of Noise_. The book is set in a sort of dialogue between Cardinal
Sarah and Nicolas Diat, inspired by a visit the Cardinal made to Grande
Chartreuse, the motherhouse of the Carthusian Order. This place, and the men who
live there, can be seen in the wonderful documentary _Into Great Silence_. The
filmmaker proposed the movie to the monks in 1984, and they asked for time to
consider it. Sixteen years later, they responded in the affirmative. He used a
single camera and no artificial light. As a feat of technical filmmaking, it's
wonderful. More precious still is the intimate look at this most austere of
orders - a community of hermits.  

Cardinal Sarah writes about silence - in prayer, worship, and secular life. It's
slow going - he's a methodical, contemplative writer:

>Christ's public life is rooted in and supported by the silent prayer of
his hidden life. The silence of Christ, God present in a human body, is
hidden in the silence of God. His earthly speech is inhabited by the
silence speech of God.  
>The whole life of Jesus is wrapped in silence and mystery. If man wants to
imitate Christ, it is enough for him to observe his silences.  
>The silence of the crib, the silence of Nazareth, the silence of the Cross, and
the silence of the sealed tomb are one. The silences of Jesus are silences of
poverty, humility, self-sacrifice, and abasement; it is the bottomless abyss of
his kenosis; his self-emptying (Phil 2:7).  

And so we must seek the silence of the desert - within ourselves first of all.
These means calling our relationship with noise by its name: a dictatorship
under which we should (and do) chafe. We have forgotten, in large part, what
true silence really is. I had forgotten, if indeed I ever knew it, until I sat
in the empty chapel at Gethsemane several years ago. The silence was so profound
as to feel positively physical. Time passes differently there, and you can
return to yourself - to your senses - like the prodigal son.  

In other news...with Lent underway, we have started our small group study. We
meet on Monday evenings, here at our home. The first session went very well.
Looking forward to next week. RCIA continues apace. The Elect have moved into
the Purification and Enlightenment period. Looking ahead, I need to start
preparing content for Mystagogy, which we're sort of rebooting. In the
background of all of this, the application process for diaconal formation is
coming to a close. Lots of self-examination, meditation, and prayer going on.
