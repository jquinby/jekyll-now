title: Tanquerey on Love
---
> Is it, indeed, so difficult to love Him Who is infinitely lovable
and infinitely loving? The love that He asks of us is nothing extraordinary;
it is the devotedness of love --- the gift of oneself --- consisting chiefly
in conformity to the divine will. To want to love is to love. To keep the 
commandments for God's sake is to love. To pray is to love. To fulfill our 
duties of state in view of pleasing God, this is likewise to love. Nay more,
to recreate ourselves, to take our meals with the like intention is to love. 
To serve our neighbor for God's sake is to love. Nothing then is easier, God's
grace helping, than the constant exercise of divine love and through this, steady
advance toward perfection.  --- Chapter 3, No. 350
