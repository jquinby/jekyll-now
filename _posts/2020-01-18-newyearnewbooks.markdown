title: New year, new books
---

Christmas is done, Epiphany is finished and here I am with a stack of new books:
_Doors in the Walls of the World_ by Peter Kreeft, _The Golden Rhinoceros_ by
François-Xavier Fauvelle, _The Rule of Benedict_ by Georg Holzherr OSB, and a
guide to gardening with local Tennessee plants. I'm still slowly working my way through
Tanquerey's _Spiritual Life_, which I'm liking very much. I used parts of it for
a recent RCIA lesson on sin and temptationm, in particular the explanations of the
threefold concupiscence. I've just started the section on the capital sins - also very 
engaging stuff.

I like Kreeft's books. This one feels like it could have been a transcript of a lecture - 
very conversational and approachable. There are moments where his enthusiasm is nearly
too much, that maybe the printed word is just barely enough to hold him still. Reading him 
is like having a couple of beers with a friend who just happens to be on fire and can't
wait to ignite you as well. But in a good way of course.

I had another meeting with the director of vocations yesterday. The process continues, and 
I left with another book recommendation: _The Noonday Devil_ by Dom Jean-Charles Nault, OSB. 
This is an exploration and study of acedia, more commonly known as sloth, one of the seven
capital sins. From the dust-jacket blurb:

>The word "sloth", however, can be misleading for acedia is not laziness; in fact it can
manifest itself as business or activism. Rather, acedia is a gloomy combination of weariness,
sadness, and lack of purposefulness. It robs a person of his capacity for joy and leaves him
feeling empty, or void of meaning.

_The Noonday Devil_ will be going with me next week as I head to
a weekend men's retreat.
