title: Choosing Books
--- 
The stuff I read falls into the following categories:

#### Theology, Philosophy, Religion, and History 
By far the largest bucket. Books tend to lead from one to the next,
sometimes because I see a reference in a footnote or hear someone
on a podcast mention something in passing related to something
I'm reading. An author or work might come up over and over and if
I'm not familiar with the person or the book, there's a good
chance it'll get added to my queue. This is the stuff usually
covered here in the blog. _First Things_ is a frequent go-to for
titles, though usually in the context of the articles rather than
the book reviews. These are the Serious Books. 

#### Deliberately work-related 
Books squarely in the realm of Business writing. My least favorite 
genre, and usually something I only visit once every few years. 
Tom Peters, Clayton Christensen, and Geoffrey Moore are who you're 
likely to find here. I'm not much for the corporate book _du jour_ 
(e.g. _Who Moved My Cheese_ and the like). It has to have real 
currency in the industry or be something that everyone at HQ is 
passing around, knowledge of which I hope will help me read the 
corporate tea leaves.

#### Things tangential to work but formative
Usually, but not always, technical material. Could be something like 
_Thinking in Systems_ by Donella Meadows or _Weapons of Math Destruction_ 
by Cathy O'Neil. I get a couple of pubs from ACM; they'd fall into 
this category too (_Communications_ and _Transactions on Internet 
Technology_). _Getting to Yes_ by Fisher and Ury are another example. 

#### Everything else Frankly a potpourri. 
Big-idea scifi or historical fiction (think Jeff VanderMeer, Frank 
Herbert, and Patick O'Brian), nature writing (Henry Beston, Wendell 
Berry, and Anne Dillard). _The Atlantic_. Current stuff circulating 
in the nerd/Catholic blogosphere.

#### Online stuff and Podcasts 
All over the map, but I reliably visit the following at least 
once a day/listen semi-regularly: Arts and Letters Daily, Longreads, 
Hacker News, Get Religion, 99% Invisible, odds and ends from the ARRL.
