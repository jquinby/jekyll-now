title: Choosing Books
---
The stuff I read falls into the following categories:

#### Theology, Philosophy, Religion, and History
By far the largest bucket. Books tend to lead from one to the next, sometimes because I see a reference in a footnote or hear someone on a podcast mention something in passing related to something I'm reading. An author or work might come up over and over and if I'm not familiar with the person or the book, there's a good chance it'll get added to my queue. This is the stuff usually covered here in the blog. _First Things_ is a frequent go-to for titles, though usually in the context of the articles rather than the book reviews. These are the Serious Books. 

#### Deliberately work-related 
Book squarely in the realm of Business writing. My least favorite genre, and usually something I only visit once every few years. Tom Peters, Clayton Christensen, and Geoffrey Moore are who you're likely to find here. I'm not much for the corporate book _du jour_ (e.g. _Who Moved My Cheese_ and the like; it has to have real currency in the industry or be something that everyone at HQ is passing around. By reading it I hope to have a more accurate fix on the corporate tea leaves. 

#### Things only tangential to work
Usually, but not always, technical material. Could be something like _Thinking in Systems_ by Donella Meadows or _Weapons of Math Destruction_ by Cathy O'Neil. I get a couple of pubs from ACM; they'd fall into this category too (_Communications_ and _Transactions on Internet Technology_). 

#### Everything else
Frankly a potpourri. Big-idea scifi or historical fiction (think Jeff VanderMeer, Frank Herbert, and Patick O'Brian), nature writing (Henry Beston, Wendell Berry, and Anne Dillard). _The Atlantic_. Current stuff circulating in the nerd/Catholic blogosphere.

#### Online stuff and Podcasts
All over the map, but I reliably visit the following at least once a day/listen semi-regularly: Arts and Letters Daily, Longreads, Hacker News, Get Religion, 99% Invisible, odds and ends from the ARRL.
